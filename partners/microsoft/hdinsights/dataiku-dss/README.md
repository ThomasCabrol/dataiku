### Summary
This template adds an edge node to an existing HDInsight cluster, then installs Dataiku DSS on the edge node, pre-configured to work with the cluster

### Dataiku DSS
<a href="http://www.dataiku.com/dss/">Dataiku DSS</a> is a collaborative data science software platform that enables teams to explore, prototype, build, and deliver their own data products more efficiently.
Dataiku DSS is:
* an all-in-one tool to build your project end-to-end, from preparation to deployment.
* a common platform to bring together data scientists, analysts, and data ops alike.
* a software to help leverage and scale your existing infrastructure: whether SQL data warehouse or Spark cluster.
* an environment to promote the coexistence of all standard (big) data science technologies and languages.
Dataiku DSS offers a complete set of functionalities to access, manage, wrangle, visualize, analyze and predict data, no matter their format and sources. 

### Dataiku DSS and HDInsight
Dataiku DSS is the perfect companion of your HDInsight cluster, thanks to the following features:
* get your data in or out the HDInsight cluster transparently
* access, transform, analyze and visualize your HDFS datasets
* use "Visual Recipes" to perform common and advanced data wrangling tasks with no code, and automatically turned them into MapReduce or Spark jobs pushed to the underlying HDInsight cluster
* use "Coding Recipes" to express custom business logic and perform advanced analytics using MR-based (Hive, Pig) or Spark-based (Scala, PySpark, SparkSQL or SparkR) layers
* create supervised or unsupervised machine learning models in a few clicks using MLLib or H2O
* interactively analyze large datasets using Jupyter Notebooks
In any case, Dataiku DSS will leverage the underlying HDInsight cluster as much as possible to ensure maximum scalability and performance.
